To create an OpenGL context for running unit tests, RapidGL uses GLFW,
developed by Marcus Geelnard and Camilla Beglund.  It is licensed under an
unmodified zlib/libpng license, and it may be obtained from
http://www.glfw.org.

For unit testing, RapidGL uses CppUnit, developed by Michael Feathers, Jerome
Lacoste, E. Sommerlade, Baptiste Lepilleur, Bastiaan Bakker, Steve Robbins, and
Harvey Brydon.  It is licensed under the LGPL v2.1, and it may be obtained from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit.
