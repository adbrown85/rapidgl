RapidGL - Rapid prototyping for OpenGL

RapidGL is a framework for creating and prototyping OpenGL applications
quickly and efficiently.  Rather than coding OpenGL directly, developers
compose a scene out of nodes corresponding to OpenGL operations.  The nodes
take care of tying themselves together, and the scene can be written in XML to
avoid recompiling the program each time.

To install RapidGL, see the INSTALL document.  For a rundown on the changes
between versions, see the NEWS document.  Lastly, if you want to experiment
with the code or contribute new features or fixes, please see the HACKING
document.
