Bugs, feature requests, and other issues can be reported using RapidGL's issue
tracker on GitHub.

    http://github.com/adbrown85/rapidgl/issues

To experiment with RapidGL or to contribute new features or fixes, first check
out the code from GitHub using Git.

    git clone git://github.com/adbrown85/rapidgl.git

Then create the configure script using Autoconf by running the 'bootstrap'
script as shown below.

    ./bootstrap

Next, follow the installation steps as detailed in INSTALL.  Note you may want
to disable optimization by changing the compiler flags when you execute the
configure script as shown below.  Note we specify the '-g' flag here to make
sure debugging symbols are created.

    ./configure CXXFLAGS=-g

To contribute code back, consider doing your work in a GitHub fork.  Or send
patches generated using Git's 'format-patch' command.  The example below
creates a patch for each commit made since pulling from GitHub.

    git format-patch origin/master..
