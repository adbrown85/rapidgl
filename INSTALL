To install RapidGL from a distribution, first make sure you have the necessary
tools and dependencies installed.  You will need g++, GNU Make, and GLFW.
Windows users will need to install a Bourne-compatible shell, like the one
provided with MinGW.

Then extract the archive and execute the following three commands:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X may need to provide
administrator privileges to install RapidGL in the default directory.  On Mac
OS X and Ubuntu, precede the install command with 'sudo' as shown below.

    sudo make install

The installation directory that RapidGL is installed into can be modified by
specifying the 'prefix' option to the configure script.

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME

To make sure RapidGL is working as expected, execute the command below.  If it
completes without error, RapidGL should be ready to go.

    make check

Once RapidGL is installed, it may easily be included in a project by using
pkg-config.  It will report the flags needed to compile and link RapidGL with
your project.  Use backticks to pass its output to your compiler.  The example
below builds a program that has RapidGL as a dependency.

    g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs glycerin-0` MyApp.cxx -o MyApp

To generate documentation, make sure Doxygen is installed and then run the
command below.

    make html

Finally, RapidGL can be uninstalled by running the command below.

    make uninstall
